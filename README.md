# Sensors-and-Control-Dobot-Calibration
This code was created by Mila Burnham (12904013), Benjamin Cooper (14284347) and Suraj Kattera (98130242). There is a script code script for visual servoing, camera data collection, accessing live camera footage and camera calibration calculation along with some additional support scripts. The code files have comments inside of them for further information and breakdown of each script. Each team member had an equal contribution towards creating the code.
The data collection file is the collection of images and the point cloud and Dobot joint state during each image. 
The calibration and relative pose file is our program containing our calibration process using the MATLAB toolbox and the relative pose calculation between the camera and end effector.
The visual servoing file displays our image based visual servoing program.
The Lx file is an interaction matrix function used in the visual servoing program.
